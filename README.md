NASA has this cool thing called [Astronomy Picture Of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). This code lets you download the picture of the current day and send it to Telegram.

The following environment variables need to be available:

- CHAT_ID: chat ID of the Telegram chat you want to send it to.
- BOT_TOKEN: token of the bot used to send the message to the chat
- NASA_API_KEY: Of course, the key to access the NASA API.

Enjoy!
